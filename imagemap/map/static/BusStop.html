            A bus stop is a designated location where buses pick up and drop off passengers along their routes. It is a key component of public transportation systems, helping connect people to various destinations, such as schools, workplaces, and markets. Bus stops are usually marked with signs displaying route numbers, schedules, and other information.

Many bus stops are equipped with seating, shelters, and lighting to provide comfort and safety for waiting passengers. In urban areas, they may also include electronic displays showing real-time arrival times. Accessibility features, such as ramps or tactile indicators, are often provided for individuals with disabilities.

Bus stops play a crucial role in making public transport efficient and convenient, encouraging eco-friendly travel and reducing traffic congestion. They serve as essential points for commuters to access affordable and reliable transportation services
