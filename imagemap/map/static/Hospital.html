        <h2>A hospital is a healthcare facility that provides medical diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients. It typically includes departments like emergency services, inpatient and outpatient care, surgery, and specialized units such as pediatrics or cardiology. Staffed by doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, hospitals also house diagnostic labs, pharmacies, and ICUs. They may be public or private, general or specialized, and often serve as hubs for community health services. Hospitals play a vital role in saving lives and promoting well-being</h2>
