            A medical pharmacy is a healthcare facility responsible for the preparation, dispensing, and management of medications to support patient health. It plays a critical role in healthcare by ensuring that patients receive the correct medications in the appropriate dosages. Pharmacies stock a variety of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and medical supplies such as syringes, bandages, and supplements.

Pharmacists, the professionals managing pharmacies, are trained to provide expert advice on medication use, including potential side effects, drug interactions, and proper storage. They also counsel patients on how to take their medications safely and effectively to achieve the best outcomes.

Modern pharmacies may operate within hospitals, clinics, or as standalone units in communities. Many also offer additional services like vaccination administration, health screenings, and prescription refills. By ensuring the safe and efficient delivery of medications, pharmacies play an indispensable role in improving public health and supporting medical treatment plans
